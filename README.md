# hello-world

Hello world! My name is Ariel and I am a strategic, open minded individual with a love for learning, a passion for helping others, and a desire to challenge the status quo. I am a visionary, with an entrepreneurial spirit and energy that is contagious. In my free time, I enjoy tutoring, traveling, playing guitar and practicing yoga. I love the outdoors and consider myself somewhat of an adventure junkie. I am also extremely intrigued by culture and language and speak Spanish, Italian, and a bit of Mandarin. I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub community!
